This code sample uses the InfiniteGraph database to analyze data from disparate datasources. Three relational databases have been exported to CSV (located in the resources directory). A REST server is used to send the merged graph to the Gephi visualization application for analysis. 

Instructions:
1. Install the free evaluation of InfiniteGraph
2. Install maven
3. mvn compile
4. mvn exec:exec (this ingests the csv into the graph)
5. Edit pom.xml changing com.infinitegraph.csv.Load to com.infinitegraph.rest.Server
6. mvn compile
7. mvn exec:exec (this launches the REST server)
8. Install Gephi and the streaming api plugin
9. Use the following URL for the Gephi client stream - http://localhost:8182/getGraph/gephiJSON (note: you can check if it's working in a browser)
